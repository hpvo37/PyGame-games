# PyGame-games
The PyGame-games repository composes of all the python games i made using Pygame module. 

The games are made as attempts to have a deeper understanding of the Pygame module which let programmers utilize 
the computer grpahics and sound library to create programs with interactive graphics (such as video games,etc.)

These are all solo projects. Images are simple as i self-drew them with MS Paint.
